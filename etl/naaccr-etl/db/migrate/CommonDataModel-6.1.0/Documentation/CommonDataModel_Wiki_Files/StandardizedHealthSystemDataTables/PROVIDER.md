### Conventions 

No.|Convention Description
:--------|:------------------------------------
| 1  | Many sources do not make a distinction between individual and institutional providers. The PROVIDER table contains the individual providers. |
| 2  | If the source, instead of uniquely identifying individual providers, only provides limited information such as specialty, generic or 'pooled' Provider records are listed in the PROVIDER table. |
| 3  | A single Provider cannot be listed twice (be duplicated) in the table. If a Provider has more than one Specialty, the main or most often exerted specialty should be recorded. |
| 4  | Valid Specialty Concepts belong to the 'Specialty' domain. |
| 5  | The CARE_SITE_ID represent a fixed relationship between a Provider and her main Care Site. Providers are also linked to Care Sites through Condition, Procedure and Visit records. |
