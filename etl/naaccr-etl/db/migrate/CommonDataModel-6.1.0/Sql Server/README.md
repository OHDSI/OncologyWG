Common-Data-Model / SQL Server
=================

This folder contains the SQL scripts for SQL Server. 

In order to create your instantiation of the Common Data Model, we recommend following these steps:

1. Create an empty schema.

2. Execute the script `OMOP CDM sql server ddl.txt` to create the tables and fields.

3. Load your data into the schema.

4. Execute the script `OMOP CDM sql server indexes.txt` to add the minimum set of indices and primary keys we recommend.

5. Execute the script `OMOP CDM sql server constraints.txt` to add the foreign key constraints.

Note: you could also apply the constraints and/or the indexes before loading the data, but this will slow down the insertion of the data considerably.

6. Repeat steps 1-3, executing the script `OMOP CDM Results sql server ddl.txt` to create the results schema
