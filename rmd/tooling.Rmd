## KOIOS

Github: [OHDSI/KOIOS](https://github.com/OHDSI/Koios)

KOIOS is a tool developed by Odysseus Data Services Inc that allows you to find matching and missing concepts in OMOP Genomic Vocabulary for most types of raw patient-level genomic data. The current tool functionality allows to extract relevant variant information from VCF files, or detect HGVS in any TXT/CSV file. In the next step, KOIOS finds corresponding HGVS references in ClinGen for each variant, and maps the results to OMOP Genomic vocabulary. Extracted HGVS references can be used as either synonyms for the existing OMOP Genomic concepts, or as new entities.

# **Regimen Derivation**

## ARTEMIS 

Github: [OdyOSG/ARTEMIS](https://github.com/OdyOSG/ARTEMIS)

ARTEMIS provides an interface for utilizing a modified Temporal Smith-Waterman (TSW) algorithm, derived from 10.1109/DSAA.2015.7344785, to summarize longitudinal EHR data into discrete regimen eras. Primarily intended to be used for cancer patients, ARTEMIS utilizes data derived from the HemOnc oncology reference to form the basic regimen data used in testing.

## OncoRegimenFinder

*Last update 2021*

Github: [OHDSI/OncologyWG/OncoRegimenFinder](https://github.com/OHDSI/OncologyWG/tree/master/OncoRegimenFinder)

This package identifies oncology regimens. Firstly, it identifies all patients who have been exposed with an Antineoplastic Agent (ATC code). Then it collapses the antineoplastic agents into regimens when there is a date difference less that @date_lag_input(30days is used as standard).

# **Database Characterization and Validation**

<br> 

## Purpose

Provide a semi-automated and extensible framework for generating, visualizing, and sharing an assessment of an OMOP-shaped database's adherence to the OHDSI Oncology Standard (tables, vocabulary) and the availabilty and types of oncology data it contains.

## Overview

The star of the framework is an R Package. Along with cataloguing an extensible set of queries and analyses used for assessing OMOP-shaped oncology data, the R package provides functionality for the four major processes involved in the framework:

1) Authoring an assessment specification
2) Executing an assessment specification
3) Generating assessment results
4) Visualizing assessment results

### Approach

_Assessments_ can be executed against an OMOP-shaped database to create a characterization and quality report. They are created using specificications. 

_Specifications_ are JSON files that describe an assessment. They are composed by compiling analyses together with threshhold values. 

_Analyses_ execute a query and return a row count or proportion describing the contents in the database. For example, analysis_id=1234 returns "the number of cancer diagnosis records derived from Tumor Registry source data".

_Threshholds_ provide study specific context to the results of analyses. An analysis asks how many cancer diagnoses derived from tumor registry data are in the database. Using threshholds, an assessment author can give ranges for "bad", "questionable", and "good" analysis results as they pertain to their study. An example threshhold, which would be encoded as JSON, could express the sentiment "A database with 0-200 diagnoses from tumor registry data would be unfit for this study, 201-500 diagnoses may be suitable, and over 500 diagnoses will be more enough."

### Extensibility

This tool is a product of collaboration. See the validation scripts README for detailed instructions on creating analyses (TODO) and using the R package to author and execute assessment specifications (TODO).
