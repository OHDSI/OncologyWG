# **Approach**

TODO: bullet summary points
e.g. breaking up into small pieces; everything ends with documentation; linear development cycle; evolving scope, etc. 

---

## Architecture 

 - (TODO) Explanation of project vs. github repo 
 - (TODO) Navigation of project vs. Github issues
 - (TODO) End deliverables will be: building concept and concept_relationship tables; documentation/conventions; deployment tool


## Project Views 

 - (TODO) 1) illustrate the intention of each view
 - (TODO) 2) show can one can contribute to specific task types by navigating views 
    If youâ€™d like to contribute to a specific Task Group,  add yourself as an assignee and change the status from Outstanding to In Progress



# **Example vertical sprint walkthrough**

 - Top level: Task groups
