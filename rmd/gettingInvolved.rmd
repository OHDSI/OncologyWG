# **Join collaboration channels**

<br>

We communicate and coordinate through the OHDSI Microsoft Teams environment and Github. 

## 1) MS Teams

To join the MS Teams environment you need to complete two steps:

| # | task | link | 
|:-|:-|:-|
| 1 | Sign up for an OHDSI Teams Account | [link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lAAPoyCRq0q6TOVQkCOy1ZyG6Ud_r2tKuS0HcGnqiQZUQ05MOU9BSzEwOThZVjNQVVFGTDNZRENONiQlQCN0PWcu)|
| 2 | Register for the workgroup by filling out the specified form selecting the tickbox for "Oncology" - which will automatically add you to our channel | [link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lAAPoyCRq0q6TOVQkCOy1ZyG6Ud_r2tKuS0HcGnqiQZUOVJFUzBFWE1aSVlLN0ozR01MUVQ4T0RGNyQlQCN0PWcu)|

Once you've joined the Oncology WG teams, there is a "Workgroup - Oncology -> [**General"** channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A239caede18574bc183f75a7a5eb9e826%40thread.tacv2/?groupId=25293b33-d337-4867-a5f5-cd314582a34e&tenantId=a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5) where we encourage new members to say **"hi!"** and let us know how we can best collaborate together.

## 2) Github

We use Github in a variety of ways including project planning and topic specific discussions. 

The root link to our Github page is: https://github.com/OHDSI/OncologyWG

And the Github 'Project' where we manage our work can be found here: https://github.com/orgs/OHDSI/projects/13
<br>

# **Submit a new collaborator form** 

(Optional) This form asks a few questions to help us understand your areas of interest, resources, and appetite for taking on different kinds of work. We're hoping this can speed up the process of getting the right folks connected and up to speed. 

Additionally, the form asks for a Github username so that we can add you as a contributor to the project. 

Google Form link: 	https://forms.gle/R8hYMY3qH2TkqyuX9

# **Review Project Documentation**

Becoming familiar with our development approach is highly recommended:

 - [Development Effort Overview](development.html)
 - [Github Project Orientation](githubProject.html)

# **Contributing**

## Submitting content

- **Use cases**: There is a specific "issue template", similar to a form, that we ask you fill out. "Issues" -> ["New Issue"](https://github.com/OHDSI/OncologyWG/issues/new/choose) -> "Use Case" (currently under construction). There is also a ['use cases' channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Aaec07bd25b014f5fb2d0e3f900c01930%40thread.tacv2/Use%20cases%20-%20Oncology%20WG?groupId=25293b33-d337-4867-a5f5-cd314582a34e&tenantId=a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5) in teams to facilitate conversations. 
- **Questions**: We have a specific ["Helpdesk"](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Ab38d09e840eb4dcf84f100b88cde7339%40thread.tacv2/Helpdesk?groupId=25293b33-d337-4867-a5f5-cd314582a34e&tenantId=a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5) channel in teams  which is intended to serve as a Q&A for the effort. Should clarity be needed or direction be given or anything in between - Ask away and we'll try to steer you in the right direction.
- **Documentation Gaps**: Please create a standard issue and we will triage it appropriately 
- **Everything else**: Please see the Project documentation above

## Taking on work
- If you are already a contributor to the OncologyWG Github repository, assign yourself to that ticket and comment within it your intent. 
- Otherwise, make a comment on the Github ticket for that task stating your intent and you will be invited to the repository and assigned accordingly, and then please go sign up for Github :) 
- There will also be opportunities during our development calls to assign tasks should that be easier
