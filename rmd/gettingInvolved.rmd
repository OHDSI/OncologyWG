# **Join collaboration channels**

We communicate and coordinate through the OHDSI Microsoft Teams environment and Github. 

## MS Teams

Once you've joined the Oncology WG teams, there is a "Workgroup - Oncology -> General" channel where we encourage new members to say hi and let us know how we can best collaborate together. 

## Github

We use Github in a variety of ways including project planning and topic specific discussions. 

The root link to our Github page is: https://github.com/OHDSI/OncologyWG

And the Github 'Project' where we manage our work can be found here: https://github.com/orgs/OHDSI/projects/13
