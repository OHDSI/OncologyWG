# **Overview**

TODO: Description of maturity sprint

---

## Goals 

 - Collaboratively mature the oncology standards in OMOP
 - Enable asynchronous mechanisms of collaboration for greater international interoperability
 - Establish conventions that apply to the various representations of oncology data
 - Thoroughly document all conventions from both an ETL and analysis perspective to facilitate standardized representation



## Scope / Timeline

 - An extensive and international outreach effort has been conducted to aggregate the gaps and pain points of implementing oncology data in OMOP, which is the starting point of this project 
 - Complete as much as we can, prioritized by use cases, in preparation for a new stable release at the beginning of 2024. After that milestone is reached, we will continue to iterate and improve while   adhering to a stable release schedule TBD.  
 - The majority of the outlined work is either investigating or modifying the vocabularies. These have been and/or will be broken down into smaller more easily tackled chunks such as “investigating an issue” or “complete outstanding vocabulary changes that have content provided”, or “documentation of _”.  This is to help enable lots of small contributions from a larger community. 
 - We are moving at a faster pace than the official OHDSI vocabulary releases and consequently will be maintaining a “delta”, or “development”, version of the vocabularies. At the end of this effort we plan to have these changes folded back into the standards. Additionally we will consult with the vocabulary team when applicable. 

## Core Values

 - Inclusion of as diverse of data as possible
    - International applicability
    - Clinical, registry, and other specialized data sources
    - Source EMR agnostic
 - Enabling interoperability and standardized analytics 
    - Non-ambiguous, Standardized representation within OMOP; For a specific type of source data, there is a single standard representation for it
    - Improving and sometimes inventing new vocabulary relation mechanisms to enable reliable and reusable phenotyping and analysis 
    - Encourage a diverse community to contribute towards a universal representation

## What we need

 - Diverse community contribution 
 - Feedback on decision points from oncology data holders and SME
 - Experienced issues & hurdles
 - Use cases
 - Development/vocabulary effort

## Distinction of efforts 

 - TODO
  - Oncology maturity sprint vs.
  - OHDSI Oncology Vanguard Network vs. 
  - OHDSI Oncology Working group

# **Project Management**

(TODO): bullet summary points



## Collaborative approach

 - Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join the effort 
 - To enable international contributions and rapid progress, we are facilitating communication both within meetings and asynchronously through Github and Teams. Any decision points discussed during the calls will also be represented in Teams for further discussion before final decisions are made
 - The Github Project will be the main resource for tracking the project deliverables, progress, and avenues for contribution
 - Discussions around items will be held off-line within MS Teams environment 


## Meetings

 - PM: Danielle Boyce
 - Cadence: (TODO) Bi-Weekly; alternating EST morning and evening.
 - Agenda Template : 
   1) Introductions/ Updates
   2) Project deliverable updates: Scrum/Agile style
   3) Any study updates
   4) Remainder: (if discussion needed) Proposals
      - Only presentations and clarifying questions during call. Discussions and decisionsto be had in teams 
      - Prompt presenters/speakers beforehand
      - If possible, put video recording of "framing" during meeting into discussion area


## Github Project

 - While discussions will be had in Teams, the project will be tracked and managed through Github. 
 - The link to the project can be found here: https://github.com/orgs/OHDSI/projects/13
 - Please review the Github Project Orientation materials: [Github Project Documentation](githubProject.html)
 - To learn how to best get involved, please also visit: [Getting Involved](gettingInvolved.html)
