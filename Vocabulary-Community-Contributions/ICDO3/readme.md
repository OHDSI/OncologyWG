## Purpose
Under the OHDSI Vocabulary and CDM working group's community contributions model *(link needed)*, the Oncology WG has agreed to take responsibility for numerous vocabularies critical to the work of observational research in Oncology *(readme and then link needed for overall project)*. The present subdirectory represents the efforts of the maintainers to update the ICD-O-3.2 vocabulary specifically. Updates will be made based upon the reported and programmtically discovered problems with the vocabulary.

To the extent possible, prior background information will be provided where publically available, including forum posts, OHDSI work group recordings, and code individuals have agreed to share with the maintainers. Credit will be listed within the code, and will be provided in the background resources. 

Code generated as part of this process will be kept under the ICDO3 primary directory here. When possible, it will be transitioned to the Vocabulary WG, via vocabulary community contribution guidelines, as applicable per guidelines available on day of submission.
